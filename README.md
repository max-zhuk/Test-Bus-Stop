The console application takes the source file path as an argument and generates a file "output.txt" in the same directory where the source file is located.
Simple logs about the program operations and errors are printed to the console.
You can start application from "DLab/src/main/java/com/project" as:  javac Main.java <path-to-sourse-file>
